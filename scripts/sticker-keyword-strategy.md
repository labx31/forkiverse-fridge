# Sticker Keyword Strategy - Comprehensive Revision

## Philosophy
Each sticker should own a **specific semantic domain** in tech/project space. Avoid generic emotional keywords (happy, cool, awesome) unless that's the sticker's PRIMARY purpose.

## Major Duplication Issues to Fix

### DESSERTS (8 stickers share "sweet")
- **popsicle** → Frozen/cold tech, caching, Redis
- **strawberry** → Fresh produce, organic, farm-to-table, local-first
- **donut-purple** → Morning routines, breakfast automation, daily habits
- **donut-pink** → Pink/feminine tech, accessibility, inclusive design
- **cherries** → Pair programming, duos, redundancy, failover
- **heart-lollipop** → Valentine's, dating apps, matchmaking, romance tech

- **candy-wrapper** → Packaging, bundlers, webpack, rollup, vite

### RELAX/CHILL (6 stickers)
- **just-cool-it** → Temperature control, cooling systems, thermal
- **tea-cup** → Coffee/tea (already good)
- **sleepy-heart** → Sleep tracking, bedtime, nighttime automation
- **cat-stretching** → Yoga, fitness, flexibility, wellness

### NATURE (6 stickers)
- **get-lost** → Maps, navigation, GPS, location services
- **take-a-hike** → Outdoor activities, trail guides, hiking specific
- **sunflower** → Solar, renewable energy, sustainability
- **feather** → Lightweight, minimal, tiny, micro-services
- **leaf-branch** → Growth, sprouting, early-stage, seedling
- **flower-simple** → Blooming, maturity, garden planning

### EMOTIONS (spread across many)
- **smile-blob** → General positivity (ONLY one that should be generic happy)
- **happiness-mushroom** → Fungi, foraging, nature ID, biology
- **smiley-rave** → 90s retro nostalgia (already good)
- **sunshine-text** → Motivational, affirmations, daily quotes

## Implementation Notes

1. **Remove all generic emotion overlap** - Only smile-blob gets "happy", only sunshine-text gets "positive" as general terms
2. **Specialize food items** - They're not just "sweet", they represent specific tech concepts
3. **Tech-first thinking** - Keywords should match actual tech project domains
4. **Unique primary domain** - Each sticker should be THE go-to for its domain
5. **Secondary keywords OK** - But primary keywords should be unique
